- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.1
- **React**: 19.2.3

## Project Description

### Advanced Automated Security Assessment Tool for Web Applications

Full-stack application with Next.js (API routes) and optional Python for specific modules.

This is a web tool that, with explicit consent from the owner, automates advanced non-destructive analysis of a URL, correlates findings with vulnerability databases, and generates a PDF report. An AI module will interpret results and draft the report and recommendations.

### Key Features

- **Consent/Authorization Management**: Signed consent/authorization before executing any analysis.
- **Reconnaissance/OSINT**: WHOIS, crt.sh, DNS, geo/IP/ASN, public searches (controlled Google dorks - optional).
- **Technology Identification**: Fingerprinting (headers, meta, Wappalyzer).
- **Respectful Enumeration**: Crawling of public routes and endpoint detection (respecting robots.txt and rate limits).
- **Public Exposure Information**: Query APIs like Shodan/Ipinfo for ports/services already indexed - no external active scans.
- **Passive Detection Heuristics**: For vectors (reflected parameters, potentially vulnerable inputs) - marked as "potential" (no exploitation).
- **Automatic Correlation**: With NVD/Vulners/OSV and searches for public exploit references (references only).
- **AI Module**: Interpretation of findings, prioritization and automatic drafting of executive summary, technical recommendations and risk score justification.
- **PDF Report Generation**: With evidence, referenced CVEs, risk score and concrete mitigation steps.
- **Validation Testing**: In controlled lab environment (DVWA / Juice Shop) to demonstrate detection and verification without affecting third parties.
- **Secure Development Pipeline**: GitHub Actions (lint, tests, SAST and dependency scanning).

### Master's Degree Subjects Involved

**Offensive Security**:
- Ethical Hacking
- Advanced Security Testing
- Cyber Intelligence and Cyber Threats
- DeepWeb/DarkWeb Research

**Defensive Security**:
- Cybersecurity Architecture
- Cybersecurity and Disruptive Technologies
- Risk Management
- Crisis Management and Cyber Resilience
- Security Incident Response Team Management
- Software Development Security
- Regulations and Legislation

### Important Note

All tests on third-party domains will be performed only with written authorization from the owner; no exploitation or DDoS tests will be executed against third parties.

## Development Guidelines

- Use Bun as package manager (not npm/yarn)
- Follow Next.js 16 App Router conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling
- Run linting before build: `bun run lint && next build`
- Respect robots.txt and rate limits in all automated scans
- Never execute destructive tests or exploitation without explicit authorization
- All security testing must be non-destructive and respectful
- Maintain clear separation between passive reconnaissance and active testing

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration (eslint-config-next)
- Use functional components with React 19
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Include proper type definitions for all functions and components
- Screaming arquitecture
